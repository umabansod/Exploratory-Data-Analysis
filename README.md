Exploratory Data Analysis on Sales Data Warehouse (SQL )


Designed and implemented Fact (Sales) and Dimension (Customer, Product) tables using a Star Schema in the Gold Layer of a Data Warehouse.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 5+ years of historical sales data using SQL:

Identified key trends in sales revenue, quantity sold, customer demographics, and product performance.

Generated business KPIs: Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Price, Top Products, Top Customers, and Year-over-Year growth.

Created analytical reports and dashboards in Power BI:

Built interactive visualizations for sales trends, customer segmentation (VIP, Regular, New), category contribution, and cost segmentation.

Developed complex SQL queries for:

Ranking (Top N products/customers by revenue).

Time-based analysis (YoY, MoM, cumulative sales, moving averages).

Performance benchmarking against average and previous year.

Ensured data quality by validating completeness and consistency across Gold Layer tables.

Delivered actionable insights that highlighted revenue drivers, high-value customers, and cost patterns.

## Customer Report 
Created a Customer Analytics View (gold.report_customers) to analyze customer performance and segmentation using advanced SQL features:

Built CTEs (base_query, customer_aggregation) for cleaner modular queries.

Computed customer-level metrics:

Total Orders, Total Sales, Total Products Purchased.

Recency, Lifespan, Average Order Value, Monthly Spend.

Applied customer segmentation logic:

VIP, Regular, New Customers based on tenure and spending.

Age Groups (e.g., 20-29, 30-39).

Implemented RFM-like indicators (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).

Delivered a reusable SQL View for integration with Power BI dashboards for customer insights.
